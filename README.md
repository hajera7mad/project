        <h1>Travel to Greece</h1>
        <p>
         is a country located in Southeast Europe.<br> Its population is approximately 10.7 million as of 2018; Athens, the nation's capital, is its largest city.
        </p>
        
        <h2>Geography and climate</h2>
        
        <p>Located in Southern and Southeast Europe, Greece consists of a mountainous, peninsular mainland jutting out into the sea at the southern end of the Balkans, ending at the Peloponnese peninsula (separated from the mainland by the canal of the Isthmus of Corinth) and strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, Asia, and Africa Due to its highly indented coastline and numerous islands,<br> Greece has the 11th longest coastline in the world with 13,676 km (8,498 mi); its land boundary is 1,160 km (721 mi). The country lies approximately between latitudes 34째 and 42째 N, and longitudes 19째 and 30째 E,<br> <strong>with the extreme points being:</strong>

        </ul></div>
        </p>
       
        <p id="climate">
        The climate of Greece is primarily Mediterranean, featuring mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. <br>This climate occurs at all coastal locations, including Athens, the Cyclades, the Dodecanese, Crete, the Peloponnese, the Ionian Islands and parts of the Central Continental Greece region. The Pindus mountain range strongly affects the climate of the country, as areas to the west of the range are considerably wetter on average  than the areas lying to the east of the range (due to a rain shadow effect).

        <h4>Santorini Island</h4>
        <p >
    officially Thira , is an island in the southern Aegean Sea, about 200 km (120 mi) southeast of Greece's mainland.<br> It is the largest island of a small, circular archipelago, which bears the same name and is the remnant of a volcanic caldera.<br> It forms the southernmost member of the Cyclades group of islands, with an area of approximately 73 km2 (28 sq mi) and a 2011 census population of 15,550. The municipality of Santorini includes the inhabited islands of Santorini and Therasia, as well as the uninhabited islands of Nea Kameni, Palaia Kameni, Aspronisi and Christiana.

  One of the major reasons why the island of Santorini stands out is its distinctive architecture. Along with its other special characteristics they compose the extraordinary beauty that makes Santorini unique. It shares the same features with the rest of the islands that lie in the Aegean Sea, especially the Cyclades, with the typical whitewashed houses, blue-domed churches and paved paths. Nevertheless, the potential and the peculiarities of the landscape have played an important role in its architectural style and formed its particular characteristics.<br>Santorini is defined by the simplicity and adaptability of its buildings.<br> The main building materials are, of course, volcanic which are abundant thanks to the well-known volcano; volcanic dust, black igneous rock, red rock and pumice stone.<br> Two basic architectural characteristics of the island are the domes and the cave houses, whose construction is easy and inexpensive. They were used as residences by poorer inhabitants due to their low cost, as they made use of what nature provided. Some settlements of Santorini are built on the edge of the caldera cliff, others extend outside the fortified castle-towns, known as kastelia, to various directions and the rest of them are nestled in the rocks. <br>
